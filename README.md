## Simplifying Location Identification: 
- The current process for identifying and referencing specific locations in Wikimedia Commons is cumbersome and lacks user-friendliness.
- So, we Develop a clickable map integrated within Wikimedia Commons, allowing users to search for locations by coordinates, zoom in/out, marks.

### Instructions to run

	npm install 
 	npm start

 Note: make sure you download the current updated version of npm.
